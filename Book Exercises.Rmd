# Book Exercises

This is an R Markdown document with a personal solution to the exercises from the book [Programming Skills for Data Science](https://github.com/programming-for-data-science) from _Michael Freeman_.

## Chapter 4 - Using Markdown for Documentation

### Exercise 1
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called README.md. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.
In your README.md document, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote.
Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly.

### Exercise 2
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called README.md. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.
In your README.md document, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in bold), course title (in italics), and instructor name.
Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly.

### Exercise 3
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called README.md. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.
In your README.md document, provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far. In particular, you should include the following:
- A heading with the name of the command;
- An example of how it can be used (formatted as a code block);
- A list of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used).

## Chapter 5

### Exercise 1: practice with basic R syntax

##### Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born
```{r}
hometown <- "Campo Bom"
```

##### Assign your name to the variable `my_name`
```{r}
my_name <- "Jesse"
```

##### Assign your height (in inches) to a variable `my_height`
```{r}
my_height <- 70.8661
```

##### Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have
```{r}
puppies <- 3
```

##### Create a variable `puppy_price`, which is how much you think a puppy costs
```{r}
puppy_price <- 1000
```

##### Create a variable `total_cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies
```{r}
total_cost <- puppies * puppy_price
total_cost
```

##### Create a boolean variable `too_expensive`, set to TRUE if the cost is greater 
##### than $1,000
```{r}
too_expensive <- ifelse(total_cost > 1000,
                        TRUE,
                        FALSE
                        )
too_expensive
```

##### Create a variable `max_puppies`, which is the number of puppies you can 
##### afford for $1,000
```{r}
max_puppies <- 1000%/%puppy_price # %/% means divide and ignore remainder
max_puppies
```

## Chapter 6

### Exercise 1: Exercise 1: calling built-in functions

#### Create a variable `my_name` that contains your name
```{r}
my_name <- "Jesse"
my_name
```

#### Create a variable `name_length` that holds how many letters (including spaces)
#### are in your name (use the `nchar()` function)
```{r}
name_length <- nchar("Jesse Oliveira")
```

#### Print the number of letters in your name
```{r}
name_length
```

#### Create a variable `now_doing` that is your name followed by "is programming!" 
#### (use the `paste()` function)
```{r}
now_doing <- paste("Jesse", "is programming!")
now_doing
```

#### Make the `now_doing` variable upper case
```{r}
toupper(now_doing)
```

### Bonus

#### Pick two of your favorite numbers (between 1 and 100) and assign them to 
#### variables `fav_1` and `fav_2`
```{r}
fav_1 <- 7
fav_2 <- 14
```

#### Divide each number by the square root of 201 and save the new value in the
#### original variable
```{r}
fav_1 <- fav_1 / sqrt(201)
fav_1
fav_2 <- fav_2 / sqrt(201)
fav_2
```

#### Create a variable `raw_sum` that is the sum of the two variables. Use the 
#### `sum()` function for practice.
```{r}
raw_sum <- sum(fav_1+fav_2)
raw_sum
```

#### Create a variable `round_sum` that is the `raw_sum` rounded to 1 decimal place.
#### Use the `round()` function.
```{r}
round_sum <- round(raw_sum,1)
round_sum
```

#### Create two new variables `round_1` and `round_2` that are your `fav_1` and 
#### `fav_2` variables rounded to 1 decimal places
```{r}
round_1 <- round(fav_1,1)
round_1
round_2 <- round(fav_2,1)
round_2
```

#### Create a variable `sum_round` that is the sum of the rounded values
```{r}
sum_round <- sum(round_1,round_2)
sum_round
```

#### Which is bigger, `round_sum` or `sum_round`? (You can use the `max()` function!)
```{r}
round_sum
sum_round
max(round_sum,sum_round)
```
### Exercise 2: using built-in string functions

#### Create a variable `lyric` that contains the text "I like to eat apples and 
#### bananas"
```{r}
lyric <- "I like to eat apples and bananas"
lyric
```

#### Use the `substr()` function to extract the 1st through 13th letters from the 
#### `lyric`, and store the result in a variable called `intro`
#### Use `?substr` to see more about this function
```{r}
intro <- substr(lyric,1,13)
intro
```

#### Use the `substr()` function to extract the 15th through the last letter of the 
#### `lyric`, and store the result in a variable called `fruits`
#### Hint: use `nchar()` to determine how many total letters there are!
```{r}
fruits <- substr(lyric,15,nchar(lyric))
fruits
```

#### Use the `gsub()` function to substitute all the "a"s in `fruits` with "ee".
#### Store the result in a variable called `fruits_e`
#### Hint: see http://www.endmemo.com/program/R/sub.php for a simpmle example (or 
#### use `?gsub`)


#### Use the `gsub()` function to substitute all the "a"s in `fruits` with "o".
#### Store the result in a variable called `fruits_o`


#### Create a new variable `lyric_e` that is the `intro` combined with the new
#### `fruits_e` ending. Print out this variable


#### Without making a new variable, print out the `intro` combined with the new
#### `fruits_o` ending
