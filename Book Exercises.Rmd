# Book Exercises

This is an R Markdown document with a personal solution to the exercises from the book [Programming Skills for Data Science](https://github.com/programming-for-data-science) from _Michael Freeman_.

## Chapter 4 - Using Markdown for Documentation

### Exercise 1
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called README.md. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.
In your README.md document, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote.
Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly.

### Exercise 3
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called README.md. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.
In your README.md document, provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far. In particular, you should include the following:
- A heading with the name of the command;
- An example of how it can be used (formatted as a code block);
- A list of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used).

## Chapter 5

### Exercise 1: practice with basic R syntax

##### Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born
```{r}
hometown <- "Campo Bom"
```

##### Assign your name to the variable `my_name`
```{r}
my_name <- "Jesse"
```

##### Assign your height (in inches) to a variable `my_height`
```{r}
my_height <- 70.8661
```

##### Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have
```{r}
puppies <- 3
```

##### Create a variable `puppy_price`, which is how much you think a puppy costs
```{r}
puppy_price <- 1000
```

##### Create a variable `total_cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies
```{r}
total_cost <- puppies * puppy_price
total_cost
```

##### Create a boolean variable `too_expensive`, set to TRUE if the cost is greater 
##### than $1,000
```{r}
too_expensive <- ifelse(total_cost > 1000,
                        TRUE,
                        FALSE
                        )
too_expensive
```

##### Create a variable `max_puppies`, which is the number of puppies you can 
##### afford for $1,000
```{r}
max_puppies <- 1000%/%puppy_price # %/% means divide and ignore remainder
max_puppies
```

## Chapter 6

### Exercise 1: Exercise 1: calling built-in functions

#### Create a variable `my_name` that contains your name
```{r}
my_name <- "Jesse"
my_name
```

#### Create a variable `name_length` that holds how many letters (including spaces)
#### are in your name (use the `nchar()` function)
```{r}
name_length <- nchar("Jesse Oliveira")
```

#### Print the number of letters in your name
```{r}
name_length
```

#### Create a variable `now_doing` that is your name followed by "is programming!" 
#### (use the `paste()` function)
```{r}
now_doing <- paste("Jesse", "is programming!")
now_doing
```

#### Make the `now_doing` variable upper case
```{r}
toupper(now_doing)
```

### Bonus

#### Pick two of your favorite numbers (between 1 and 100) and assign them to 
#### variables `fav_1` and `fav_2`
```{r}
fav_1 <- 7
fav_2 <- 14
```

#### Divide each number by the square root of 201 and save the new value in the
#### original variable
```{r}
fav_1 <- fav_1 / sqrt(201)
fav_1
fav_2 <- fav_2 / sqrt(201)
fav_2
```

#### Create a variable `raw_sum` that is the sum of the two variables. Use the 
#### `sum()` function for practice.
```{r}
raw_sum <- sum(fav_1+fav_2)
raw_sum
```

#### Create a variable `round_sum` that is the `raw_sum` rounded to 1 decimal place.
#### Use the `round()` function.
```{r}
round_sum <- round(raw_sum,1)
round_sum
```

#### Create two new variables `round_1` and `round_2` that are your `fav_1` and 
#### `fav_2` variables rounded to 1 decimal places
```{r}
round_1 <- round(fav_1,1)
round_1
round_2 <- round(fav_2,1)
round_2
```

#### Create a variable `sum_round` that is the sum of the rounded values
```{r}
sum_round <- sum(round_1,round_2)
sum_round
```

#### Which is bigger, `round_sum` or `sum_round`? (You can use the `max()` function!)
```{r}
round_sum
sum_round
max(round_sum,sum_round)
```
### Exercise 2: using built-in string functions

#### Create a variable `lyric` that contains the text "I like to eat apples and 
#### bananas"
```{r}
lyric <- "I like to eat apples and bananas"
lyric
```

#### Use the `substr()` function to extract the 1st through 13th letters from the 
#### `lyric`, and store the result in a variable called `intro`
#### Use `?substr` to see more about this function
```{r}
intro <- substr(lyric,1,13)
intro
```

#### Use the `substr()` function to extract the 15th through the last letter of the 
#### `lyric`, and store the result in a variable called `fruits`
#### Hint: use `nchar()` to determine how many total letters there are!
```{r}
fruits <- substr(lyric,15,nchar(lyric))
fruits
```

#### Use the `gsub()` function to substitute all the "a"s in `fruits` with "ee".
#### Store the result in a variable called `fruits_e`
#### Hint: see http://www.endmemo.com/program/R/sub.php for a simpmle example (or 
#### use `?gsub`)
```{r}
fruits_e <- gsub("a","ee",fruits)
fruits_e
```


#### Use the `gsub()` function to substitute all the "a"s in `fruits` with "o".
#### Store the result in a variable called `fruits_o`
```{r}
fruits_o <- gsub("a","o",fruits)
fruits_o
```


#### Create a new variable `lyric_e` that is the `intro` combined with the new
#### `fruits_e` ending. Print out this variable
```{r}
lyric_e <- paste(intro,fruits_e)
print(lyric_e)
```

#### Without making a new variable, print out the `intro` combined with the new
#### `fruits_o` ending
```{r}
paste(intro,fruits_o)
```

### Exercise 3: writing and executing functions

#### Define a function `add_three` that takes a single argument and
#### returns a value 3 greater than the input
```{r}
add_three <- function(value) {
  value + 3
}
```

#### Create a variable `ten` that is the result of passing 7 to your `add_three` 
#### function
```{r}
ten <- add_three(7)
ten
```

#### Define a function `imperial_to_metric` that takes in two arguments: a number 
#### of feet and a number of inches
#### The function should return the equivalent length in meters
```{r}
imperial_to_metric <- function(feet,inches) {
  meters <- ( feet * 0.3048 ) + (inches * 0.0254)
  meters
}
```

#### Create a variable `height_in_meters` by passing your height in imperial to the
#### `imperial_to_metric` function
```{r}
height_in_meters <- imperial_to_metric(5,9.0551)
height_in_meters
  
```

### Exercise 4: functions and conditionals

#### Define a function `is_twice_as_long` that takes in two character strings, and 
#### returns whether or not (e.g., a boolean) the length of one argument is greater
#### than or equal to twice the length of the other.
#### Hint: compare the length difference to the length of the smaller string
Personal solution:
```{r}
is_twice_as_long <- function(string1,string2) {
  if(nchar(string1) >= nchar(string2)*2 ) {
    TRUE
  } else
  {FALSE}
}
```

Book solutions:  -> it is not necessary to use if (conditional) because R already evaluates TRUE or FALSE based on strings lengths.
```{r}
is_twice_as_long_book <- function(str1, str2) {
  diff <- abs(nchar(str1) - nchar(str2))
  min_length <- min(nchar(str1), nchar(str2))
  diff >= min_length # if difference is more than short
}
```

#### Call your `is_twice_as_long` function by passing it different length strings
#### to confirm that it works. Make sure to check when _either_ argument is twice
#### as long, as well as when neither are!
Personal solution:
```{r}
call1 <- is_twice_as_long("lalala","lala")
call1

call2 <- is_twice_as_long("lalala","la")
call2

call3 <- is_twice_as_long("lala","la")
call3
```

Book solution:
```{r}
is_twice_as_long_book("dog", "elephant")
is_twice_as_long_book("elephant", "dog")
is_twice_as_long_book("dog", "cat")

```

#### Define a function `describe_difference` that takes in two strings. The
#### function should return one of the following sentences as appropriate
####   "Your first string is longer by N characters"
####   "Your second string is longer by N characters"
####   "Your strings are the same length!"
```{r}
describe_difference <- function(string1,string2) {
  if (nchar(string1) > nchar(string2) ) {
    difference <- paste("Your first string is longer by",nchar(string1)-nchar(string2),"characters" )
  } else if (nchar(string1) < nchar(string2)) {
    difference <- paste("Your second string is longer by", nchar(string1)-nchar(string2) ,"characters")
  } else {
    difference <- "your strings are the same length!"
  }
  difference 
}
```

#### Call your `describe_difference` function by passing it different length strings
#### to confirm that it works. Make sure to check all 3 conditions1
```{r}
describe_difference("Australia","Brazil")
```
```{r}
describe_difference("Brasil","Italy")
```
```{r}
describe_difference("Sweden","Brazil")
```

### Chapter 7

#### Exercise 1: creating and operating on vectors

#### Create a vector `names` that contains your name and the names of 2 people 
#### next to you. Print the vector.
```{r}
names <- c("Jesse","John","Doe")
print(names)
```

#### Use the colon operator : to create a vector `n` of numbers from 10:49
```{r}
n <- 10:49
n
```

#### Use the `length()` function to get the number of elements in `n`
```{r}
length(n)
```

#### Add 1 to each element in `n` and print the result
```{r}
print(n +1)
```

#### Create a vector `m` that contains the numbers 10 to 1 (in that order). 
#### Hint: use the `seq()` function
```{r}
m <- seq(from=10,to=1)
m
```

#### Subtract `m` FROM `n`. Note the recycling!
```{r}
n - m
```

#### Use the `seq()` function to produce a range of numbers from -5 to 10 in `0.1`
#### increments. Store it in a variable `x_range`
```{r}
x_range <- seq(from=-5,to=10,by=0.1)
x_range
```

#### Create a vector `sin_wave` by calling the `sin()` function on each element 
#### in `x_range`.
```{r}
sin_wave <- sin(x_range)
sin_wave
```

#### Create a vector `cos_wave` by calling the `cos()` function on each element 
#### in `x_range`.
```{r}
cos_wave <- cos(x_range)
cos_wave
```

#### Create a vector `wave` by multiplying `sin_wave` and `cos_wave` together, then
#### adding `sin_wave` to the product
```{r}
wave <- (sin_wave * cos_wave) + sin_wave
wave
```

#### Use the `plot()` function to plot your `wave`!
```{r}
plot(wave)
```

### Exercise 2: indexing and filtering vectors

#### Create a vector `first_ten` that has the values 10 through 20 in it (using 
#### the : operator)
```{r}
first_ten <- 10:20
first_ten
```

#### Create a vector `next_ten` that has the values 21 through 30 in it (using the 
#### seq() function)
```{r}
next_ten <- seq(from=21,to=30)
next_ten
```

#### Create a vector `all_numbers` by combining the previous two vectors
```{r}
all_numbers <- c(first_ten,next_ten)
all_numbers
```

#### Create a variable `eleventh` that contains the 11th element in `all_numbers`
```{r}
eleventh <- all_numbers[11]
eleventh
```

#### Create a vector `some_numbers` that contains the 2nd through the 5th elements 
#### of `all_numbers`
```{r}
some_numbers <- all_numbers[2:5]
some_numbers
```

#### Create a vector `even` that holds the even numbers from 1 to 100
```{r}
even <- seq(from=2,to=100, by=2)
even
```

#### Using the `all()` function and `%%` (modulo) operator, confirm that all of the
#### numbers in your `even` vector are even
```{r}

```

#### Create a vector `phone_numbers` that contains the numbers 8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9
```{r}
phone_numbers <- c(8,6,7,5,3,0,9)
phone_numbers
```

#### Create a vector `prefix` that has the first three elements of `phone_numbers`
```{r}
prefix <- phone_numbers[1:3]
prefix
```

#### Create a vector `small` that has the values of `phone_numbers` that are 
#### less than or equal to 5
```{r}
small <- phone_numbers[phone_numbers <= 5]
small
```

#### Create a vector `large` that has the values of `phone_numbers` that are 
#### strictly greater than 5
```{r}
large <- phone_numbers[phone_numbers > 5]
large
```

#### Replace the values in `phone_numbers` that are larger than 5 with the number 5
```{r}
phone_numbers[phone_numbers > 5] <- 5
phone_numbers
```

#### Replace every odd-numbered value in `phone_numbers` with the number 0


### Exercise 3: vector practice

#### Create a vector `words` of 6 (or more) words.
#### You can Google for a "random word generator" if you wish!
```{r}
words <- c("table", "desk", "microscope", "laptop","keyboard","mouse")
words
```

#### Create a vector `words_of_the_day` that is your `words` vector with the string
#### "is the word of the day!" pasted on to the end.
#### BONUS: Surround the word in quotes (e.g., `'data' is the word of the day!`)
#### Note that the results are more obviously correct with single quotes.
```{r}
words_of_the_day <- paste(words, "is the word of the day!")
words_of_the_day
```


#### Create a vector `a_f_words` which are the elements in `words` that start with 
#### "a" through "f"
#### Hint: use a comparison operator to see if the word comes before "f" alphabetically!
#### Tip: make sure all the words are lower-case, and only consider the first letter
#### of the word!


#### Create a vector `g_m_words` which are the elements in `words` that start with 
#### "g" through "m"


#### Define a function `word_bin` that takes in three arguments: a vector of words, 
#### and two letters. The function should return a vector of words that go between 
#### those letters alphabetically.


#### Use your `word_bin` function to determine which of your words start with "e" 
#### through "q"
