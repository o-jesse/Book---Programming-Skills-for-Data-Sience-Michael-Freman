# Book Exercises

This is an R Markdown document with a personal solution to the exercises from the book [Programming Skills for Data Science](https://github.com/programming-for-data-science) from _Michael Freeman_.

## Chapter 4 - Using Markdown for Documentation

### Exercise 1
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called README.md. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.
In your README.md document, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote.
Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly.

### Exercise 2
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called README.md. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.
In your README.md document, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in bold), course title (in italics), and instructor name.

### Exercise 3
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called README.md. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.
In your README.md document, provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far. In particular, you should include the following:
- A heading with the name of the command;
- An example of how it can be used (formatted as a code block);
- A list of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used).

## Chapter 5

### Exercise 1: practice with basic R syntax

##### Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born
```{r}
hometown <- "Campo Bom"
```

##### Assign your name to the variable `my_name`
```{r}
my_name <- "Jesse"
```

##### Assign your height (in inches) to a variable `my_height`
```{r}
my_height <- 70.8661
```

##### Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have
```{r}
puppies <- 3
```

##### Create a variable `puppy_price`, which is how much you think a puppy costs
```{r}
puppy_price <- 1000
```

##### Create a variable `total_cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies
```{r}
total_cost <- puppies * puppy_price
total_cost
```

##### Create a boolean variable `too_expensive`, set to TRUE if the cost is greater 
##### than $1,000
```{r}
too_expensive <- ifelse(total_cost > 1000,
                        TRUE,
                        FALSE
                        )
too_expensive
```

##### Create a variable `max_puppies`, which is the number of puppies you can 
##### afford for $1,000
```{r}
max_puppies <- 1000%/%puppy_price # %/% means divide and ignore remainder
max_puppies
```
